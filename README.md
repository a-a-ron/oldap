Introduction to OpenLDAP

A directory is a database optimized for reading, browsing, and searching. LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is a lightweight protocol for accessing directory services, specifically X.500 based directory services. LDAP runs over TCP/IP.

The LDAP information model is based on entries. An entry is a collection of attributes that has a globally-unique Distinguished Name (DN). Each of the entryâ€™s attributes has a type and one or more values.

LDAP is based on a client-server model. One ore more LDAP servers contain the data making up the directory information tree (DIT). The client connects to servers and asks it a questions. The server responds with an answer. No matter which LDAP server a client connects to, it sees the same view of the directory.
